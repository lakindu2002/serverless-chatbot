# A Serverless Chatbot

This aims to showcase the journey of building a cloud-native serverless chatbot driven using AWS and Next.js

## Backend

The backend is developed using AWS CDK. The reason that I've chosen AWS CDK for this is because I'm tightly working with the AWS Ecosystem and can use high level constructs offered by AWS with tested best practises to make my infrastructure management easier!

## Frontend

The frontend is developed using Next.js. The main reason I chose Next.js is due to its support for SSR that will be of good use for the future of this product.

## Product Roadmap

The roadmap will be published soon.

## Architecture

The proposed architecture will be published soon.
